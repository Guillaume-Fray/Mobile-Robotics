# Mobile-Robotics
Simulation of localisation and path planning of a small robot with 2 tracks (no wheels) on a 2D custom map with holes and cliffs.

Includes: . Implementation of forward and inverse kinematics
          . Localisation algorithms
          . Gaussian Model
          . Probabilistic Model
          . Planning, path generation and control 
          . Linear approach (turn-move-turn) 
          . Cubic interpolation approach (drive and steer)
